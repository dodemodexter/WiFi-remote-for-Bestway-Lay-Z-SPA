## How to customize

Each language is defined in a .txt file (e.g., Langue_fr-FR.txt) located in the /data directory. These files are fully editable and allow easy customization or translation updates.

‚ûï Add a new language

To add support for another language:

1. Create a new `.txt` file named `Langue_xx-XX.txt` in the `/data` folder, using the same key/value structure.
2. Edit the file `webconfig.html` and:

   - Add a new `<option>` entry inside the hidden `<select>` used by the script:

     ```html
     <option value="xx-XX">YourLanguage</option>
     ```

   - Add a new flag inside the `#lang-flags` block:

     ```html
     <span class="flag" data-lang="xx-XX" title="YourLanguage">üåê</span>
     ```

That‚Äôs all ‚Äî the system will automatically pick up and apply the new language file via `i18n.js`.

## Android App (APK)


A lightweight Android app is available to simplify access to the web interface:
[Download the APK](https://github.com/dodemodexter/WiFi-remote-for-Bestway-Lay-Z-SPA/blob/master/Code/APK/Lay-Z-By-visualapproach.apk)

This app wraps the existing web UI and makes it easier to use on mobile:

    Language is selected automatically on first launch

    The IP address of your Lay-Z-Spa module must be known and entered at first use

    Once configured, access is instant ‚Äî just launch the app

    Note: This is not a native app. It simply embeds the web UI in a dedicated container.
